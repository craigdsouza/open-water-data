  bio: Currently an independent researcher in the development sector with a keen interest in water resources and agriculture. Graduated with a Masterâ€™s in Energy and Environmental Policy in 2013 and then worked as a researcher with the Society for Promoting Participative Ecosystem Management, undertaking river basin studies in central and eastern India. Craig believes that the democratization of data and the tools to derive insights from data holds tremendous potential for addressing issues of inequity and environmental sustainability in India. He contributes to these efforts as co-ordinator of Datameet-Pune, the city chapter of datameet.org
