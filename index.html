	<p> Understanding water in all its forms in every part of the water cycle is vital to ensuring its sustainable
		and equitable management. Whether there is a scarcity of water or an excess of it, knowing precisely the quantum
		of water, whether underground in aquifers, embedded in the soil as soil moisture or in numerous lakes, reservoirs
		and rivers is vital. Knowing where and to what degree water is consumed, in agriculture or water thirsty cities
		and industries is equally essential to encourage judicious use of the resource. Moreover it isn't sufficient to
		know the movement and quantum of water if that knowledge is in the hands of a select few.
	</p>
	<p> The democratization of access to data of water we believe holds much promise. It potentially allows 
		communities the possibility to come together for making decisions that impact both drinking water security
		and agriculture immensely. Many factors play a role in preventing management of water as a common 
		property resource, however a paradigm shift in the availability of water resources data would go a long way 
		towards	addressing the problem.
	</p>
	<p> This platform, an initiative of <a href="http://datameet.org/">Datameet</a> and the <a href="https://cis-india.org/">
		Centre for Internet and Society (CIS)</a> is an effort in that direction. Water in India being a State subject is largely 
		monitored only by government agencies. While much of the data they collect is inaccessible to the average 
		citizen, many open datasets from remotely sensed imagery of Earth await exploration. The hurdle though is the lack of 
		technical knowledge to access this data. What if instead, we had access to a web platform, open, free, 
		accessible to everyone and most importantly intuitive to understand to someone with little technical or 
		programming knowledge.
	</p>
	<p> As this initiative evolves we will be blogging updates to this site. Stay tuned! If anything here interests
		you and you wish to collaborate, send us a mail at pune@datameet.org
